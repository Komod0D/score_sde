# Observations

- VP SDE seems to be more stable than VE SDE

- Slightly increasing depth helped eval loss but only a bit: maybe dramatically increasing depth needed?

- 32 dim hidden features much faster and works fine for VP sde, experiment with more depth



# Needed:

- Visualisation for partial generation, i.e. along the SDE

- More experiments at different depths, maybe increase dataset size?
